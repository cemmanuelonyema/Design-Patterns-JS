Software design patterns implemented in JavaScript

In this repository, I have built the same project (Todo App) using different software design patterns.

## Introduction
In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), a **software design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design). It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) or [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

[Object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) or [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)), without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) intermediate between the levels of a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) and a concrete [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).
